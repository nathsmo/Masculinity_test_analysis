# Masculinity test analysis
## By Nathalia Morales
## June 2019

As part of my personal summer projects I decided to analyze a masculinity test to discover new insights about the data. I also decided to implement my own version of this test but only for latino america men.

## Description of data according to the original website of extraction:

**This directory contains data behind the story What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man?**
* masculinity-survey.csv contains the results of a survey of 1,615 adult men conducted by SurveyMonkey in partnership with FiveThirtyEight and WNYC Studios from May 10-22, 2018. The modeled error estimate for this survey is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points. The percentages have been weighted for age, race, education, and geography using the Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey to reflect the demographic composition of the United States age 18 and over. Crosstabs with less than 100 respondents have been left blank because responses would not be statistically significant.

**raw-responses.csv** contains all 1,615 responses to the survey including the weights for each response. Responses to open-ended questions have been omitted, including those where a respondent explained what they meant by selecting the "other" option in response to a question.

**masculinity-survey.pdf** contains the questions corresponding to the colums in the raw responses file.
